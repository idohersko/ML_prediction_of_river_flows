## Overview

Southern Israel faces a critical challenge in water resource management due to the lack of historical hydraulic flow data. This repository presents a machine learning approach to predict historical river flows using high-resolution 10-minute meteorological data. The project includes data collection, feature engineering, model training, and a GUI application for further research.


## Datasets

All the csv datasets are available in the data directory.
Our data sources :
- **IMS Data**: Meteorological data obtained from the Israeli Meteorological Service (IMS).
- **Flows Data**: River flow data from the Water Authority in Israel for three periods.
- **Link Data**: Dataset for setting up time windows and links between meteorological and hydraulic stations.
- **Hydraulic Stations**: Hydraulic station data from the Water Authority.
Every dataset can be analyzed with visualizations in the visualizations.ipynb

## Models and Analysis
In this repository you will find 3 models for each link betweeen meteorological station and hydraulic stations, resulting in a total of 63 ML models. 
In order to access them, you can (1) run the main_code.ipynb, (2) use the GUI application.

We are also providing a code for analysis of the model using SHAP.
